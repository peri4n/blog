I am Fabian. I am a software developer at [Senec](https://www.senec.de), nerd, hobby gardener, and full-time dad.

In a previous life, I was a data scientist working in academia but left when I realized how deeply screwed science is; I never looked back.
Still, my interests remain in working with large data sets, functional programming, and security. In particular:

## Languages

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/)/[Java](https://dev.java)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Technologies

- [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/)

## Certificates

- AWS Solution Architect (Associate)

I write about the things that go through my head: the day-to-day problems I face in my job, as well as nerd topics I am interested in.
I hope this proves to be useful for you and the rest of the internet.
